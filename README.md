# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Project

This project aims to analyze coffee shop sales using Excel and Power Pivot to identify key trends, product performance, and customer behavior. It will track sales revenue, best-selling items, peak hours, and the impact of promotions to improve pricing and inventory management. Additionally, it will assess operational efficiency by analyzing stock turnover and staff performance to optimize business operations.  

The outcome will be an interactive dashboard with charts and graphs for real-time insights. This will help refine marketing strategies, enhance customer engagement, and maximize profitability. Ultimately, the project will provide a data-driven approach to improving sales, efficiency, and long-term business success.
